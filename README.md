# simple_linear_regression_insurance_analysis

BootCamp project utilising Simple Linear Regression

Project name: Insurance table analysis through simple Linear Regression Method 

Description: Simple Linear Regression method is used to find the relationship between different variables in the insurance table.

Contents: LinearRegressionfrom sklearn.linear_model is used to create a simple linear regression model in this case. And MatplotLib charts are used to visualise this. 
pearsonr method from scipy.stats is used to define the correlation. The model is also then used to predict an unknown value.

Usage: This project was created for studying purposes.
